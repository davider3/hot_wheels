# Progress Update 4

David Reinhardt

Relative to my original schedule I am staying right on track but some of my future milestones have changed because of some of the changes I have needed to make

## Success Criteria (in order of priority)

* [ ] Car can drive
* [ ] Car can turn
* [ ] Car is controlled by a wireless controller
* [ ] FPV video stream works
* [ ] Racing sim setup
* [ ] Car will have headlights

## Mechanical

I have done a lot of research and design work for the front suspension and have ordered all of the parts to begin making it. The same material that I ordered for it will be used for the drive train.

I have also been test fitting everything into the car and been grinding down the parts of the car that I won't need. I am feeling pretty confident about fitting everything inside even though it is such a small car. It will be one of the most difficult parts of this project though

## Electrical

I created a full electrical schematic and have started soldering some of the components to the main microcontroller.

## Software

I have interfaced with all of the components that I currently have but am still waiting for the radio controller to arrive. That will be a difficult part of this as well
