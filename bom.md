- I have already gotten the camera on the Xiao ESP32S3 to stream to a local server that it is hosting which I expected to be much more difficult but I got it first try
- I have been doing a lot of ordering of the different components this week and the majority are on their way, the rest I will have ordered by this saturday
- I was able to successfully remove the base of the hot wheels ferrari with out destroying it which is something else I was slightly worried about
